# Maths

# Palindrone N.

Approach➖

copy original no to new no.

x+=new no to modulo 10 multiply by 10

original ==reverse then true. 

# Factorial Trailing Zeros

Approach➖

- Zeros only happen if 5 x 2.
- no of 5 is more than 2
- check for powers of 5 also

```cpp
int trailingZeroes(int n)
        {
            int ans = 0;
            for (int i = 5; i <= n; i *= 5)
            ans += n / i;
            return ans;
        }
```

# Prime No.

Approach :- check from 1 to root N

**Dont use it for a range of numbers.

# Prime No. in Range N

Sieve of Eratosthenes

approach ➖

- make an array of 1 to N with all true except 1 (which is False)
- put elements of array and its multiples to false from 1 to root N
- those elements which are true are primes

# Euclid GCD

,   GCD of two numbers is HCF

Gcd is found by 

GCD(a,b)=GCD(a-b,b)   When a>B

               =GCD(b,  a%b)

# Transpose of a matrix

swap elements of ij to ji 

setting updating condtions of j up to I only otherwise it will update 2 times. 

```cpp
void transpose(vector<vector<int> >& matrix, int N)
    { 
        for (int i=0;i<N;i++)
        for (int j=i;j<N;j++)
        swap(matrix[i][j],matrix[j][i]);
    }
```
