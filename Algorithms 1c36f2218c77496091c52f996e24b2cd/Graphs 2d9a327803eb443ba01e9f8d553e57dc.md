Copy graph

adjacency list (array of vectors)

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> printGraph(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
        // Code here
        
        vector<vector<int>> ans(V, {0});
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            ans[i][0] = i;
            for (int v: adj[i]) {
                ans[i].push_back(v);
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
        
    }

# Kruskals

1. Sort all the edges from low weight to high  (ElogE)
2. Take the edge with the lowest weight and add it to the spanning tree. If adding the edge created a cycle, then reject this edge.  (logV)
3. Keep adding edges until we reach all vertices   (ElogV)

Psudeo

```cpp
KRUSKAL(G):
A = ∅
For each vertex v ∈ G.V:
    MAKE-SET(v)
For each edge (u, v) ∈ G.E ordered by increasing order by weight(u, v):
    if FIND-SET(u) ≠ FIND-SET(v):       
    A = A ∪ {(u, v)}
    UNION(u, v)
return A
```

# Prims

Approach

1. Initialize the minimum spanning tree with a vertex chosen at random.
2. Find all the edges that connect the tree to new vertices, find the minimum and add it to the tree
3. Keep repeating step 2 until we get a minimum spanning tree

```cpp
T = ∅;
U = { 1 };
while (U ≠ V)
    let (u, v) be the lowest cost edge such that u ∈ U and v ∈ V - U;
    T = T ∪ {(u, v)}
    U = U ∪ {v}
```
